# VirtualJoystick

Futuristic UWP Virtual Joystick (C#)

### Information
VirtualJoystick is a virtual touch-enabled joystick, 
made specifically for the Universal Windows Platform.

VirtualJoystick is unlike any other UWP based joystick. VirtualJoystick
is visually pleasing and flexible. Support for gamepad and touch is present.

If you're operating on less powerful hardware and desire to eliminate
all advanced visual effects, make sure to correctly tamper with all
constant boolean variables.

This is written in C# (7.x) and requires no other dependencies
except for the built-in ones that is included in UWP.

### Installation
VirtualJoystick is extremely easy to install.

1. Copy ```Joystick.xaml``` and ```Joystick.xaml.cs``` 
to your desired directory within your UWP project. 
Then, copy all (or both) resources from the ```Resources``` 
directory, to the ```Resources``` directory within your UWP project.

2. Ensure that all resources are properly imported.

3. Rebuild your project solution and correct any minor errors.

4. Configure ```Joystick.xaml.cs``` constant booleans.

5. Run.
